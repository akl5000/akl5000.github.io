      <description>Character Creation Guide People like to make characters in very different ways.

      <description>Introductions to the Mechanics of DND Playing DND consists of 2 general gameplay modes, Adventuring and Combat. All sessions consist of one or more of these modes. In this section, I will try to summarize the two modes to hopefully give some clarity about what situations might arise in a typical session. After that, I will try to cover the dice and chance aspect of the game, along with an explanation of how your ability scores and skills come into play.</description>
