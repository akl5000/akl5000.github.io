      <description>Beggar From the naive eye, beggars look like a plague that coat the cities across the continent. But others, those who understand the wisdom hidden behind the beggars few words, understand the true worth of those people.
Wisdom from the Land Beggars are the brain of the continent. A band of brothers making up the poorest people of the continent, but with the skills to rival the major guilds. Alone, a beggar can become a formidable foe, but together, their combined wisdom and experiences can make armies crumble.</description>

      <description>Brutalist While other fighting styles choose to imbue their weaponry and movements with essence. Brutalists take a more intrusive approach. By brutally infusing their bodies with essence, an unarmed fighting style becomes most effective. Whether or not a brutalist uses this power to bring health or destruction is up to them.
Imbued palms The brutalist fighting style utilizes the lightweight capabilities of martial arts. With the essence flowing through their bodies, their palms become as deadly as a sword.</description>

      <description>Ranger Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the most distant farms close to the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch. While the bow and arrow are considered lowly compared to the fierce close quartered arts of the sword or spear, a true master of the bow can make any person, no matter the strength, feel real despair.</description>

      <description>Soundsmith Ascetics and musicians roam the continent, but few infuse their music with essence. Those who do inspire and delight people wherever they may travel. Among those people, even fewer are prepared to use their talent for battle. Those people, those who will inspire their comrades while having the will to destroy their foes, are called Soundsmiths.
Battle Maestro Soundsmiths are few and far between, but no modern battle has ever been won without them.</description>
