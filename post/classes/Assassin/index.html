  <h1 id="assassin">Assassin</h1>
<p>Assassins rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p>
<h3 id="skill-and-precision">Skill and Precision</h3>
<p>Assassins devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many Assassins focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks. Some focus their efforts on the mysteries of the scales, finding cunning and oppressive ways of overwhelming their opponents.
When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a proficient Assassins imbues themselves with essence to supplement their other abilities.</p>
<h3 id="a-life-in-shadow">A Life in Shadow</h3>
<p>Every town and city has its share of Assassins. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into Assassin guilds such as Aghurs Shadow or Charred cloaks. Plenty of Assassins operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. 
As adventurers, Assassins fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others work for agencies looking to dabble in illegal measures. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-assassin">Creating an Assassin</h3>
<p>As you create your Assassin character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry Assassin guilds wrath? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?
What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p>
<h4 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h4>
<p>You can make an Assassin quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. The charlatan background works best for this class.</p>

<h2 id="class-features">Class Features</h2>
<p>As an Assassin, you gain the following class features</p>
<h4 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h4>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per Assassin level</li>
<li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</li>
<li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Assassin level after 1st</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="proficiencies">Proficiencies</h4>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Armor:</strong> Light Armor</li>
<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> All Thrown Weapons, Hand Crossbow, and Shortsword</li>
<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Thieves’ Tools and Poisoner’s kit</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity and Wisdom</li>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Stealth, Sleight of hand, Investigation, Deception, Perception</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>(a)</em> a Burglar’s pack or <em>(b)</em> an Explorer’s pack</li>
<li><em>(a)</em> a short sword or <em>(b)</em> a Hand Crossbow and quiver of 20 arrows</li>
<li><em>(a)</em> two poison, basic (vial) and a Poisoner’s kit or <em>(b)</em> Thieves’ Tools</li>
<li>Leather Armor and two daggers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="expertise">Expertise</h3>
<p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools or Poisoner’s kit. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
At 8th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills, thieves’ tools, or poisoner’s kit) to gain this benefit.</p>
<h3 id="assassinate">Assassinate</h3>
<p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Assassinate column of the Rogue table.</p>
<h3 id="aghurs-muddle">Aghurs Muddle</h3>
<p>During your rogue training you learned Aghurs Muddle, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows Aghurs Muddle understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of an Assassin guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for Assassins on the run.</p>
<h3 id="cunning-action">Cunning Action</h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash or Hide action.</p>
<h3 id="assassins-guild">Assassins Guild</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose a guild that you follow in the benefit of your skills: <em>Aghurs Shadow</em>, <em>Blood thorn</em>, or <em>Charred cloaks</em>, detailed at the end of the class description. Your Guild choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h3 id="predictive-dodge">Predictive Dodge</h3>
<p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>
<h3 id="stealthy-acquisition">Stealthy Acquisition</h3>
<p>At 6th level, choose an additional minor scale to learn. You may not choose the same scale twice.</p>
<p><em>Wood</em>- You gain proficiency in the <em>(a)</em> Nature skill or <em>(b)</em> Animal Handling skill<br>
<em>Fire</em>- You gain proficiency in the <em>(a)</em> Persuasion skill or <em>(b)</em> deception skill<br>
<em>Earth</em>- You gain proficiency in the <em>(a)</em> Medicine skill or <em>(b)</em> History skill<br>
<em>Metal</em>- You gain proficiency in the <em>(a)</em> Survival skill or <em>(b)</em> Athletics skill<br>
<em>Water</em>- You gain proficiency in the <em>(a)</em> Insight skill or <em>(b)</em> Investigation skill<br>
<em>Rage</em>- You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.<br>
<em>Control</em>- You gain proficiency in the Perception skill.<br>
<em>Space</em>- You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.<br>
<em>Dark</em>- You gain proficiency in the Stealth skill.</p>
<h3 id="evasion">Evasion</h3>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a Swordsman’s technique or an Soundsmith’s melody. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>
<h3 id="reliable-talent">Reliable Talent</h3>
<p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 6 or lower as a 7.</p>
<h3 id="uncanny-dodge">Uncanny Dodge</h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>
<h3 id="elusive">Elusive</h3>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.</p>
<h3 id="stroke-of-luck">Stroke of Luck</h3>
<p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

<p>Starting at level 13, when you land an attack within 5 ft of the target, instead of assassinating, you may choose to perform a special attack aided by the Dark scale. You become invisible for the next turn.</p>

<h3 id="wildfire">Wildfire</h3>
