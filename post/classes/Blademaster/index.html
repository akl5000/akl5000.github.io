  <h1 id="blademaster">Blademaster</h1>
<p>The Blademaster weighs down his limbs for the promise of strength in the future. Swinging their blades, mimicking a whirlwind. An unstoppable force that dictates the flow of the battle from the front lines. While swordsmen value fancy essence sword skills and frivolous footwork, the Blademaster opts for raw strength and speed.</p>
<h3 id="constant-training">Constant training</h3>
<p>To maintain the raw strength they require for their skills. Blademasters choose to always carry weight on themselves. Only when the iron on their limbs become as easy to carry as if it were never there in the first place, do they feel satisfied, until they increase the weight of course. Intrepid Blademasters know that there is more to combat then the speed of blades. The option of power on a battlefield can often be more valuable than power itself.</p>
<h3 id="whirlwind-of-blades">Whirlwind of blades</h3>
<p>Blademasters are often mocked by the elite for their rugged fighting style, but in truth, the mockery stems from fear. Rugged as they may be, a powerful Bladesmith can best even the most talented Swordsman. To an untrained eye, the blades of a powerful Blademaster can only be seen after their prey are killed.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>You can make a Blademaster quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the Athlete background.</p>

Beginning at 1st level, as a bonus action on any of your turns, you may fling the bracers off your hands as thrown weapons (15/25) dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage. This damage becomes multiplied by Your Bracer modifier and is rounded down.

You strike the ground with both weapons at once, driving them far into the ground and expending all bonus actions left while making this attack. A shockwave is sent out in a 30 ft cone in front of your player. For each bonus actions spent, you make a melee attack roll against a target in the cone. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage.
