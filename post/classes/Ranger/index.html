  <h1 id="ranger">Ranger</h1>
<p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the most distant farms close to the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.
While the bow and arrow are considered lowly compared to the fierce close quartered arts of the sword or spear, a true master of the bow can make any person, no matter the strength, feel real despair. Rangers choose the bow as their weapon not because they want the easy path forward, but because they know the continent will not be safe without them.</p>
<h3 id="eyes-of-a-predator">Eyes of a predator.</h3>
<p>Bow arts have existed since the dawn of civilization. Before steel, a bow existed as the only layer of protection against the powers of the wilderness. Pure, primal, strength and dexterity fuel the ranger’s fights. Unlike the rest of the distinguished fighting styles across the continent, the bow arts did not draw its power from the scales, but the untouched eye of a physical being. An eye that sees everything as prey.</p>
<h3 id="embellished-by-essence">Embellished by essence</h3>
<p>The discovery of essence posed a threat to the ranger’s livelihood, as more forms of combat entered play. But the bow arts did not miss a beat, developing a unique style that uses essence not as a source of power, but an article of precision in a keen rangers’ hands. Arrows made of essence not only changed the life of rangers, but made their participation in battles across the world necessary. As much as the world needed them. The bow arts were not for the faint of heart, and could only be learned under the most primal of conditions. This environment made the return of the ranger from their training in the wild a celebratory time for their home, as their kingdom had just gained another hero.</p>
<h4 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h4>
<p>You can make a Ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Second, choose the outlander background.</p>
