  <h1 id="militant">Militant</h1>
<p>Over the course of history, the kings and generals of the world have learned the that the most powerful weapon on the battlefield is a spear. Its range and elusiveness counter any novice swordsman. The spearmen of the continent are referred to as Militants because of this fact. The best Militants are trained into generals, learning the spear arts of the kingdoms they serve.</p>
<h3 id="discipline-and-service">Discipline and service</h3>
<p>Militants are hearty, loyal, soldiers. Their fighting spirit is unaverred, and their trust in their techniques is absolute. They are respected across the continent as the protectors of justice and the harbingers of piece. Because of their unique skill sets, Militants are trusted in positions of authority, and serve great importance in any adventuring party, although there is often better opportunities elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="techniques-that-dance">Techniques that dance</h3>
<p>The Militant masters’ techniques are best suited for war. Ironically, these techniques are some of the most breathtaking and well-constructed combat styles on the continent. Watching a spearman fight can sometimes spark inspiration in ascetics yet causes cities to crumble. The stable foundation of spear arts causes the Militant to have perfect control over the essences they imbue their weapons with. Their techniques mimic the foundational elements of the world, just like the scales represent.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>You can make a Militant quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Second, choose the Soldier background.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="equipment">Equipment</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>(a)</em> Chain shirt or <em>(b)</em> Chain Mail</li>
<li><em>(a)</em> a Dungeoneer’s Pack or <em>(b)</em> an Explorer’s pack</li>
<li><em>(a)</em> a Glaive or <em>(b)</em> a Pike</li>
<li><em>(a)</em> a Lance or <em>(b)</em> two Spears</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-balance">Weight balance</h3>
<p>Not every spear is made the same, and the weight of the spear effects not only the effects of your attacks, but the depth of your potential. Starting at 1st level, choose a weight balance for your weaponry.</p>
<h4 id="light-and-agile">Light and Agile</h4>
<p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands without the heavy modifier, you may reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon may also be versatile instead of two handed for you to gain this benefit.</p>
<h4 id="heavy-and-strong">Heavy and strong</h4>
<p>If you are attacking with a Heavy, two-handed weapon, if you roll the maximum on a weapon die, add 5 to the total damage. The weapon may also be versatile instead of two handed for you to gain this benefit.</p>
<h3 id="foundational-movements">Foundational movements</h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you gain access to the foundational movements of the spear. At the start of combat, you may utilize the spear to position yourself on the battlefield as a bonus action. The actions you may take are listed below. These actions may be reused as a bonus action when starting a turn with 0 flow (at level 2 you always have 0 flow)</p>
<p><em>Vault</em>- you use your weapons length and elasticity to vault yourself across the battlefield. You may launch yourself 15 ft in any direction and over difficult terrain. You may not move again after this bonus action for the turn.</p>
<p><em>Tower</em>-You tower yourself on top of your weapon to observe the battlefield. Any creatures within 30 ft of you which are currently hidden can be seen until the next turn. you may not move again after this bonus action for the turn.</p>
<p><em>Ground</em>-You ready yourself for oncoming attackers. You gain +2 Armor rating until your next turn or until you attack. You may not move again after this bonus action for the turn.</p>
<h3 id="flow-state">Flow State</h3>
<p>The master of the spear arts once said, “The nature of these arts is as complex as a flowing river. Unyielding and powerful, yet intricate and precise as a dagger. The systems cut through the land like a plow on a field.” Every militant follows these principles. Starting at 3rd level, you learn the basics of the flow system. Gain access to one of the three standard flows listed at the end of the class features. You may choose a second at 6th level and the third at 10th level. Flow abilities can only be used with a proficient weapon.</p>
<h4 id="initial-flow">Initial Flow</h4>
<p>Initial flow is listed on the class table. This number indicates how many flow points you start with at the beginning of a <strong>flow sequence</strong>. Using <strong>flow attacks</strong> cost an amount of flow gained over the course of a flow sequence.</p>
<h4 id="flow-sequence">Flow Sequence</h4>
<p>A <strong>flow sequence</strong> is a sequence of attacks that stretches across a combat. A flow sequence starts after the first <strong>flow attack</strong> and ends after not using a flow attack for a turn. You may not use a the same flow attack twice in a row.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 7th, 9th, 12th, 14th, 17th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h3 id="essence-flow">Essence flow</h3>
<p>You have seen spearmen attack alongside the scale’s essence in a flow state. You choose to study the scales to gain this power. At 5th level, choose a scale listed below to imbue. You may choose an additional scale again at 11th level, and again at 15th level.</p>
<p><em>Metal Scale</em><br>
You gain proficiency in the <em>(a)</em> Survival skill or <em>(b)</em> Athletics skill<br>
The metal essence may modify some of your attacks.</p>
<p><em>Water Scale</em><br>
You gain proficiency in the <em>(a)</em> Insight skill or <em>(b)</em> Investigation skill<br>
The water essence may modify some of your attacks.</p>
<p><em>Space Scale</em><br>
You gain proficiency in the Perception skill<br>
The space essence may modify some of your attacks.</p>
<h3 id="unyielding-flow">Unyielding flow</h3>
<p>Starting at 8th level your mastery of the foundations have become second nature. You may use a foundational ability as a bonus action on every turn of the combat.</p>
<h3 id="weightless-weapon">Weightless weapon</h3>
<p>Starting at 13th level, you gain the benefit of both options of weight balance. Both benefits apply on all weapons you are proficient with.</p>
<h3 id="flow-mastery">Flow mastery</h3>
<p>By 16th level, all aspects of the flow sequencies have been mastered. You can use multiple flow attacks at once. As an optional cost to a flow attack, you may spend one additional flow to choose one flow attack with the same cost or lower and add its effect to the same target or one target within your range. You may use either the main attack or the chosen secondary attack as the basis for the next flow attack.</p>
<h3 id="uncanny-attack">Uncanny Attack</h3>
<p>Starting at 18th level, you may attack twice for every attack action. The second attack cannot effect the flow sequence.</p>
<h3 id="infinite-flow">Infinite flow</h3>
<p>At 20th level, your second attack each turn can affect the Flow Sequence.</p>
<h2 id="flow-attacks">Flow attacks</h2>
<p>When asked to choose a flow sequence, choose between Flow of the metal soldier, Flow of the Surging Waters, and Flow of the Anti-World. Each ability has a listed flow cost, damage, effects, essence effect, and direct flow.</p>
<p><em>Cost</em>- the flow cost of a ability. Typically, each flow sequence has a standard ascending cost.</p>
<p><em>Damage</em>- The damage type and amount are listed. If no damage type is listed, the damage type is the type of your weapon.</p>
<p><em>Effects</em>- information about the ability and any additional effects it has or does. If any ability asks for a saving throw, the DC is calculated as 8 + Proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier, otherwise, the damage is added to your weapon and an attack role is used.</p>
<p><em>Essence effect</em>-the additional effect the ability has if the player is imbued with the corresponding essence.</p>
<p><em>Direct flow</em>-The abilities the ability flows into. The player may use any of these abilities directly after the current attack to gain one flow point instead of paying the cost.</p>
