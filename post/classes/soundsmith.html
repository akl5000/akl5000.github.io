  <h1 id="soundsmith">Soundsmith</h1>
<p>Ascetics and musicians roam the continent, but few infuse their music with essence. Those who do inspire and delight people wherever they may travel. Among those people, even fewer are prepared to use their talent for battle. Those people, those who will inspire their comrades while having the will to destroy their foes, are called Soundsmiths.</p>
<h3 id="battle-maestro">Battle Maestro</h3>
<p>Soundsmiths are few and far between, but no modern battle has ever been won without them. A talented Soundsmith can inspire thousands of people with their words alone, granting battle prowess to take down a king.</p>
<p>Some Soundsmiths choose to lay low in a battlefield, while other choose the front lines. A confident Soundsmith can infuse their instrument of choice with essence itself, giving birth to powerful psychic abilities capable of dictating the flow of a battle, corrupting the mind of their enemies, and hushing the spirits of even the loudest armies. No general has doubted the advantage a well inspired army will bring, but many have underestimated the chilling screams of an experienced Soundsmith on the other side of the battlefield.</p>
<h4 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h4>
<p>You can make a Soundsmith quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. You may choose to value Charisma over Wisdom if you value support over damage. Second, choose the entertainer background.</p>

<h3 id="inspiring-performance">Inspiring Performance</h3>
<p>Beginning at 1st level, you can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Inspiration die, a d6.</p>
<p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Inspiration die but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Inspiration die at a time.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest, or one use after a short rest.</p>
<p>You may use your action for the turn to regain one use of an inspiration die.</p>
<p>Your Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p>
<h3 id="song-of-rest">Song of Rest</h3>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains extra points equal to your inspiration die.</p>
<h3 id="mind-flay">Mind Flay</h3>
<p>Also at 2nd level, you can spin words laced with magic that unsettle a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Roll the Inspiration die. The creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.</p>
<h3 id="the-essence-of-performance">The Essence of Performance</h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you channel the essence of the scales into your performance and attacks. Choose a Scale that resonates with you and your sound.</p>

<h4 id="dark-scale">Dark Scale</h4>
<p>You gain proficiency in the Stealth Skill.<br>
You may cast Dark cantrips.</p>
<p>Also at 3rd level, your newfound essence has granted you newfound passion. Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen proficiency.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 9th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h3 id="body-of-essence">Body of Essence</h3>
<p>Starting at 5th level, you gain understanding of the essence that flows around you. The amount of essence your body can hold is listed on the class table, improvements to this amount is gained at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level.
Your essence attack and spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
<h3 id="screech">Screech</h3>
<p>At 5th level, you gain the ability to control a screeching sound so intense it can ruin the mind of a normal being. As an action, you may perform this attack with the instrument you are using by spending one essence.</p>
<p><strong>Screech</strong><br>
<em>Range:</em> 60ft<br>
<em>Damage:</em> 2d12 Thunder damage<br>
<em>Effects:</em> You play your instrument with the ferocity and control of a master. A soundwave travels into a target’s ears with 60 ft of you. The target must make a constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d12 thunder damage on a failed save, and half the damage on a successful save. This attack deals no damage to a deafened creature.</p>
<h3 id="mind-strengthen">Mind Strengthen</h3>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p>
<h3 id="combat-inspiration">Combat Inspiration</h3>
<p>At 7th level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has an Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.</p>
<h3 id="unfailing-inspiration">Unfailing Inspiration</h3>
<p>At 8th level, your inspiring words are so persuasive that others feel driven to succeed. When a creature adds one of your Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll fails, the creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die.</p>
<h3 id="font-of-inspiration">Font of Inspiration</h3>
<p>Beginning when you reach 10th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="sound-explosion">Sound Explosion</h3>

<em>Range:</em> 100ft<br>
<em>Damage:</em> 6d10 Thunder damage<br>
<em>Effects:</em> Your send a sharp soundwave out from your instrument, exploding in all directions. Up to 10 targets in a 100ft radius around you must make a dexterity saving throw. It takes 6d10 Thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This attack deals no damage to a deafened creature.</p>
<h3 id="intimidating-attractiveness">Intimidating attractiveness.</h3>
<p>At 14th level, your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely and fierce.</p>
<p>In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it can&rsquo;t attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack, or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn.</p>
<p>Once you assume this attractiveness, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="psychic-scream">Psychic Scream</h3>
<p>Beginning at 13th level, you gain the ability to output an unreal scream, damaging enemies around you. As an action, you may perform this attack with the instrument you are using by spending three essences.</p>
