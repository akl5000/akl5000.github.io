<p>While other fighting styles choose to imbue their weaponry and movements with essence. Brutalists take a more intrusive approach. By brutally infusing their bodies with essence, an unarmed fighting style becomes most effective. Whether or not a brutalist uses this power to bring health or destruction is up to them.</p>
<h3 id="imbued-palms">Imbued palms</h3>
<p>The brutalist fighting style utilizes the lightweight capabilities of martial arts. With the essence flowing through their bodies, their palms become as deadly as a sword. Brutalists harness this power to create magical effects and exceed their bodies physical capabilities. Some brutalists study the essence that flows through their bodies, opting to help mend the wounds of others around them, while other choose to display the destructive power they can output with every hand. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p>
<h3 id="isolation">Isolation</h3>
<p>Most Brutalists choose to live an isolated life. The process of imbuing your blood is a brutal one, often taking many years of rigorous, painful training to become one. Some Brutalists live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their training. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as great forces on the battlefield, at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or sometimes the scale itself.</p>
<h4 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h4>
<p>You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. You may value Charisma more than Strength if you value support over damage. Second, choose the hermit background.</p>

<p>At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use palm strikes. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed.</p>
<p>You can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your palm strikes.</p>

<p>When you use the Attack action with a palm strike on your turn, you can make an additional palm strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with your palm, you can also make a palm strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</p>
<h3 id="essence-assistance">Essence assistance</h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the lingering essence of the scales. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of essence points. Your Brutalist level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the essence column of the Brutalist table.</p>
<p>You can spend these points to fuel various essence features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more essence features as you gain levels in this class.</p>
<p>When you spend an essence point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended essence back into yourself.</p>
