  <h1 id="swordsman">Swordsman</h1>
<p>Still the most dominant style of fighting, Swordsmen continue the long history and lineage of the best warriors on the continent. Fighting alongside the power of the scales, swordsmen triumph with swift and decisive slashes, pushing the essence in their bodies to the limit, and creating art with their movements.</p>
<h3 id="tradition">Tradition</h3>
<p>The most practiced and distinguished sword techniques hail from the great sword sects across the continent. These techniques employ basic sword maneuvers imbued with the power of the scales. Masters of these sects can change the course of history with one attack. The three main sword sects battle for power between themselves. The title of the greatest sword sect is often debated within the public and fought for in wars. Swordsmen of these sects are deeply loyal, but don’t be misconstrued, a swordsman’s greatest loyalty exists for their sword, and if a sect falls, very few will have the resolve to continue its legacy.</p>
<h3 id="one-with-the-sword">One with the sword</h3>
<p>The greatest achievement a swordsman can strive for is sword-body unification. To the swordsman, the sword is the source of their power, and an instrument to channel the power of the scales into their techniques. The greatest swordsmen on the continent are indistinguishable from the sword itself. Before the thought can even manifest in their minds, the sword is already in motion. In legends, it is said that the pinnacle of swordsmanship techniques no longer requires a sword at all, with the practitioner acting as an instrument for the scales essence themselves.</p>
<h4 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h4>
<p>You can make a Swordsman quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence or Constitution. Second, choose the city watch or soldier background.</p>
