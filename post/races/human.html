  <h1 id="human">Human</h1>
<p>In the reckonings of most worlds, Humans are the foundation of the global stage. Proud, family driven, and short-lived in comparison to Spirit Beasts and Azzars. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to protect from the foreign races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.</p>
<h2 id="a-broad-spectrum">A Broad Spectrum</h2>
<p>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.</p>
<h2 id="variety-in-all-things">Variety in All Things</h2>
<p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="lasting-institutions">Lasting Institutions</h2>
<p>Where a single Beast or Azzar might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While Beast clans pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human sects, kingdoms, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek the touch of blood in the north) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.
Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.
Exemplars of Ambition
Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.</p>
<h2 id="human-regions-and-ethnicities">Human Regions and Ethnicities</h2>
<p>The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In Eribar, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern Scattered Lake Region than in the rugged Mountains of Agawrathe to the east—and even more distinctive in far-off At-Mekin. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of Eribar have every possible variation of coloration and features.
In Eribar, five human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are found in more localized areas of the continent. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which region your human is in.</p>
<h4 id="malian">Malian</h4>
<p>Taller and Paler than their fellow Humans, Malians live in the northern forests of Abre. Malians tend to have brown and black hair, with brown and hazelnut eyes.</p>
<h4 id="sycrin">Sycrin</h4>
<p>Dominant in the plains of the east, the Sycrin people are a peaceful group of tribes under the light control of the Varamu spire. These pastoral people tend to be medium sized, with dark brown hair and skin, with green or brown eyes.</p>
<h4 id="agarinians">Agarinians</h4>
<p>The mountainous region of Agawrathe is hardly a hospitable place to live, but houses the short, stocky, mountain dwelling people of Agarin. They usually have dusky skin, dark eyes, and thick black hair.</p>
<h4 id="lidraeins">Lidraeins</h4>
<p>The region of Lidrae is a diverse group of people, culture, ideologies, and terrain. the north brings the Malian people looking for open farmland, the east brings the Agarin traders, stock full of precious metals, and to the west is the scattered lakes, home of the Zarandians. The people in the region are a diverse mix of the humans across the continent, housing people of all skin tones, hair colors, and backgrounds.</p>
<h4 id="zarandians">Zarandians</h4>
<p>The lake filled region, rightly named the scattered lakes is home of some of the wealthiest humans in the continent. The people of this region are fair skinned, with blonde or dirty blonde hair and green or blue eyes. Darker hair is considered more prestigious, and almost no light-haired people are found in high-ranking positions in the capital.</p>

<h4 id="speed">Speed</h4>
<p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<h4 id="orthodox-foundation">Orthodox foundation</h4>
<p>You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic</p>
