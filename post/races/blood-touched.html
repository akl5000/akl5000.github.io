  <h1 id="blood-touched">Blood-Touched</h1>
<p>To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the Blood-Touched. And to twist the knife, Blood-Touched know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Maglore—The ancient blood god—into their bloodline. Their appearance and nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held prisoner.</p>
<h2 id="rage-filled-bloodline">Rage-filled Bloodline</h2>
<p>Blood-Touched are derived from human bloodlines, and in a sense, they still look human. However, their bloody heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Blood-Touched have red markings across their skin that make of a variety of shapes: some have large stripes running across their back and onto their forearms, some have spiraling patterns running across their face and neck. The luckiest Blood Touched have marking they can discreetly hide, evading the public’s eye. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red or blue.</p>
<h2 id="self-reliant-and-suspicious">Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h2>
<p>Blood-Touched subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect. Many cases of criminal gangs have been led by charismatic Blood-Touched who have amassed support in the criminal world.</p>
<p>The northern blood Fields are the homeland of the Blood Touched. Most people in this region are Blood-touched and due to the nature of the curse, more and more humans are becoming Blood-Touched after each generation. While humans would rather live without Blood-Touched in their communities, the same sentiment is true for the Blood-Touched themselves. It is in this territory where the powers of their race can be shown freely and without resentment. With less and less humans living in this territory as time goes on, the influence of the Blood-Touched as a global power grows in turn.</p>
<h2 id="an-uncanny-migration">An uncanny migration</h2>
<p>As the Blood-Touched are a close relative to humans, alliances and marriages often occur for some of the most progressive humans. For those humans, a happy life brings happy children, cursed by the rage scale of course. Although for some, the curse is like a blessing. Because of the nature of these relationships, power obsessed humans sometimes leave behind their race to empower their family generations to come.</p>
<h2 id="blood-touched-regions-and-ethnicities">Blood-Touched Regions and Ethnicities</h2>
<p>The physical characteristics of the Blood-Touched mirror the physical characteristics of humans in the regions they reside in. of course, the eyes of a blood touched, one of their distinguishing features, change drastically from their human counterparts, turning black, red, white, silver, or gold with no visible sclera or pupil. The purest Blood -Touched, from the oldest families of the race, have darker, redder skin tones, and are seen with darker hair colors. Blood-Touched in the Blood Fields are more likely to sport these purer characteristics, as the first Blood-Touched was born within that very region.</p>

<h2 id="blood-touched-traits">Blood-Touched Traits</h2>

<h4 id="age">Age</h4>

<h4 id="unorthodox-applicant">Unorthodox applicant</h4>
<p>As an action, you may drench a weapon or ammunition of your choice in your own blood. A creature hit by the coated weapon or ammunition must succeed on a DC 10 constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage (in addition to the damage dealt by the base weapon). The blood remains active for one minute after you apply it.</p>
<h4 id="blood-magic">Blood Magic</h4>
<p>You can use your action to unleash your latent powers. A string of blood explodes from your markings into a direction of your choosing, forming a 2 by 30 ft line. Each creature effected must make a constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 piercing damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use blood magic, you can’t use it again until a short or long rest.</p>
