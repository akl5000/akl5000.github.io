  <h1 id="azzar">Azzar</h1>
<p>The Azzar are mystical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They know much about the physical realm around them, but also of the substances in between. They walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension, and between worlds that are closer together than we could know. The Azzar are not just the protectors of the space scale, they were born from it.</p>
<h2 id="slender-and-graceful">Slender and Graceful</h2>
<p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, Azzar appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly taller than humans on average, ranging from well under 6 feet tall to just over 7 feet. They are more slender than humans, yet have a presence nobody could match. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.
Azzar coloration encompasses the normal human range but also includes skin in shades of violet, lavender, and almost bluish-black, hair of black or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Azzar have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in dark colors and wear crystalline jewelry.</p>
<h2 id="self-sufficient-devotion">Self-Sufficient Devotion</h2>
<p>To any Azzar, the space scale is more important than life itself. Azzar owe their devotion and respect to the scale above all else, even the gods. Each Azzar’s conduct reflects on the sacrality of the scale, and blasphemy can result in expulsion and exile. 
A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Azzar value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. An Azzar holds the mastery of spatial magic as a lifetime goal, and any other views are considered blasphemy. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of an Azzar.</p>
<h2 id="hidden-woodland-realms">Hidden Woodland Realms</h2>
<p>If not stationed in At-Mekin, the home of the space scale, most Azzar dwell in small forest villages hidden among the forests of Yichekin. Azzar hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few Azzar make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).
Azzar encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling artists or sages, or the occasional deserter. Human nobles compete for the services of Azzar instructors to teach magic to their children.</p>
<h2 id="azzar-regions">Azzar Regions</h2>
<p>The Azzar reside in the northwest region of Yichekin. A vast tundra stretches across the entire region, with only one small land bridge to the rest of the continent. Not many creatures leave this region, but the ones who do have a reason. The capital city of At-Mekin provides the space scale with a massive fortress guarded by the most powerful Azzar. The southern lake filled stretches of farmland supply the Azzar populace with the necessary food to survive in the tundra.</p>

<h2 id="azzar-traits">Azzar Traits</h2>
<p>Your Azzar Character has traits and abilities tailored for the protection and use of the space scale</p>
<h4 id="ability-score-increase">Ability Score Increase</h4>
<p>Your intelligence score increases by 2</p>
<h4 id="age">Age</h4>
<p>Azzar reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, but few live past the age of 60</p>
<h4 id="size">Size</h4>
<p>The height of an Azzar ranges between well under 6 feet tall to just over 7 feet. Your size is Medium.</p>
<h4 id="speed">Speed</h4>
<p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<h4 id="darkvision">Darkvision</h4>
<p>There is no such thing as light in between worlds. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
<h4 id="uncanny-attention">Uncanny Attention</h4>
<p>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
<h4 id="rift-walk">Rift walk</h4>
<p>At the start of your turn, you may step into the space between worlds as long as you aren’t incapacitated. You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, as well as see and affect creatures and objects on the spiritual Plane. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.
This feature lasts for a number of rounds equal to your intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 round). If you are inside an object when it ends, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and you take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you moved.
Once you Rift walk, you cant do so again until a short or long rest.</p>
<h4 id="spatial-awareness">Spatial Awareness</h4>
<p>If you are not Incapacitated, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>
