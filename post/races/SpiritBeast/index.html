  <h1 id="spirit-beast">Spirit Beast</h1>
<p>The great Spirit Beasts of old once ruled the continent. Mystical dragons, serpents, fish, and even birds lived peacefully in the wilderness as they pleased. When conflict arose between the spirits of old and the conquering Humans, the most powerful Spirit Beasts took up arms to defeat the invaders. The two races met on the battlefield, with the elder spirit beasts arriving in humanoid form. The battle ended in stalemate, with both sides gaining a respect for each other, man to beast.</p>
<p>Human and Spirit Beast alliances are created, each benefiting equally. Some Spirits rise to become proud leaders of Human communities. Some venture into the world to prove their worth. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds.</p>
<h2 id="scarred-and-strong">Scarred and Strong</h2>
<p>Spirit Beasts exhibit a blend of beast and human characteristics, and their appearance varies widely depending on the physical characteristics of their spirit. They are all at once indistinguishable from wild beasts yet as powerful as any human master.</p>
<p>Spirit Beasts regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, though, mark a Spirit Beast as a prisoner of war, or an exiled criminal. Any Spirit Beast who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits and injuries.</p>
<h2 id="protector-of-the-wilds">Protector of the Wilds</h2>
<p>A spirit beast is born from the wild, into the wild, and serves the wild. While other races may find joy in conquering, power, and greed, a Spirit Beast’s goal is to protect its environment. The most successful Spirit beasts cause untouched terrain to persist through the centuries. Large amounts of Spirit beasts can gather in a populated area when a powerful natural object desires protection. Other spirit beasts are more than stationary. Distressed Spirits from other natural objects that flow through the wind can lead willing Spirit Beasts on adventures, fighting to protect its lesser brethren.</p>
<h2 id="spirit-beast-regions-and-ethnicities">Spirit Beast Regions and Ethnicities</h2>
<p>The spirit Beast occupy the southern regions of Eribar. Blocked by the Straight of Elgore on the west and the Agawrathe Mountains on the east, Spirit beasts are largely left to their own devices from the neighboring human settlements. No matter the Spirit of a Spirit Beast, Beasts of all kinds can be found in all regions of the Spirit Beast kingdom, but due to geological differences, many beasts have preferences upon which land they protect.</p>
