  <h1 id="introductions-to-the-mechanics-of-dnd">Introductions to the Mechanics of DND</h1>
<p>Playing DND consists of 2 general gameplay modes, Adventuring and Combat. All sessions consist of one or more of these modes. In this section, I will try to summarize the two modes to hopefully give some clarity about what situations might arise in a typical session. After that, I will try to cover the dice and chance aspect of the game, along with an explanation of how your ability scores and skills come into play.</p>
<h2 id="adventuring">Adventuring</h2>
<p>Adventuring is the default game mode of DND. It is everything outside of combat. Things in this mode are fluid, and not held up to the same structured order as you will see in combat. Nevertheless, there is a general rhythm that takes place.</p>
<ul>
<li>The DM Describes the environment</li>
<li>The players describe what they want to do</li>
<li>The DM narrates the results of their actions</li>
</ul>
<p>This sequence could involve talking to NPC’s, discovering clues, shopping, exploring, investigating, and lots more. Often a dialogue will take place between the DM narrating an NPC and a player talking to them, sometimes having full conversations. Players can also be doing things independently. If one player wants to investigate something independently, a description will be put forth, and they will be solely responsible for interacting within that description. The description will be put to the table, but the player in that situation will have the decision on how to relay the information to the other players (embellishing or lying is allowed).
There are many other things you should know about the time spent outside of combat such as, movement, resting, interacting with objects, light levels, and so on. I would recommend reading <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring">this chapter</a> in the basic rules document outlining some information about adventuring</p>
<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>Combat is by far the most complex system in DND. The bad news is that there is a lot to learn to optimize how you fight. The good news is that while I am the one making the creatures you fight against, I am not on their side. Once I put the creatures on the battlefield, I only act as a referee, enforcing the rules and letting the dice lead the way. I will always be available to answer questions in combat regarding the best actions you could take and will always answer in your favor. I am going to summarize most of what’s important in combat, but there is a chapter in the basic rules document about combat, and I believe it is the best way to learn. You can find the document <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat">here</a>. Here is also a list of what I believe are the most important sections of that document.</p>
<ul>
<li>Actions in combat</li>
<li>Making an attack</li>
<li>Damage and healing</li>
</ul>
<p>To fully understand combat, we have to talk about how the dice play a role in DND, that will be covered below.</p>
<h2 id="ability-scores-and-dice-rolls">Ability scores and Dice rolls</h2>
<p>This is where the numbers come in. Don’t worry though, you won’t have to do more than addition and subtraction. Before I start, if you would like to read the documentation, you can find that <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores">here</a>. It is actually not that hard to follow and gives you all the information you could ever want about skills and how each ability score is used. Otherwise, I will try to summarize what I think you should know as a player heading into Character creation.</p>
<h4 id="ability-scores">Ability scores</h4>
<p>Each player or creature in DND has 6 ability scores, representing different aspects of their skills.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strength</strong>, measuring physical power</li>
<li><strong>Dexterity</strong>, measuring agility</li>
<li><strong>Constitution</strong>, measuring endurance and health</li>
<li><strong>Intelligence</strong>, measuring reasoning and memory</li>
<li><strong>Wisdom</strong>, measuring perception and insight</li>
<li><strong>Charisma</strong>, measuring force of personality</li>
</ul>
<p>These Skills range from 1 to 30 and increase as you become more powerful. Certain classes value certain ability scores more. For example, a magic class wants intelligence and a rogue wants dexterity.</p>
<h4 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h4>
<p>All actions in this game take into account what your scores are. Someone who has a high strength score should be better at feats of strength than someone with a low score. This notion is represented by affecting the dice roll of associated actions with the <a href="https://dnd5e.info/using-ability-scores/ability-scores-and-modifiers/">Ability score and modifier table</a> This table assigns a modifier to each score. That modifier modifies the dice roll for an associated action.</p>
<h4 id="other-modifiers">Other modifiers</h4>
<p>Before we talk about the rolls themselves, there are two more modifiers that come up frequently.
The Proficiency bonus is a number tied to your class level that adds a flat amount to a roll in which you are proficient. You will hear the word proficiency thrown around a lot in character creation. This just means that when you are performing an action with something that you are proficient in, you gain that amount in the total roll. This can come up if you are swinging a sword in which you are proficient or doing an acrobatic action when you are proficient in the acrobatics skill.</p>
<h4 id="advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and disadvantage.</h4>
<p>When you are given advantage or disadvantage on a roll, you roll two dice, and take either the highest or lowest number, depending on if you have advantage or disadvantage. You usually gain this modifier under the influence of certain conditions or skills. For example, if you are poisoned, your attacks have disadvantage. The DM can also give advantage or disadvantage if circumstances involved in the action dictate so. You do not need to worry about keeping track of this modifier yourself, just roll with one if the DM says so.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-rolls">Types of rolls</h3>
<p>So, what kind of rolls are you going to be making that uses these modifiers. There are three types of them, and they are called the <em>Ability check</em>, the <em>saving throw</em>, and the <em>attack roll</em>. These rolls are performed in different situations in the game, and all have different use cases. You don’t need to worry about them too much, I will ask you to make a specific type of roll when necessary. But it might be helpful to know what type of roll you will be making when you ask to do an action, just so you don’t try something impossibly unlikely.</p>
<h4 id="ability-checks">Ability checks</h4>
<p>Ability checks come up when a player attempts an action other than attacking. This could be attempting a big jump (where you would roll and add your dexterity modifier) or an attempt of investigation (where you would roll and add your intelligence modifier). The more difficult a task, the higher you will have to roll to succeed. The thresholds are determined by the DM but in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very easy = 5</li>
<li>Easy = 10</li>
<li>Medium = 15</li>
<li>Hard = 20</li>
<li>Very hard = 25</li>
<li>Nearly Impossible = 30</li>
</ul>
<p>For future reference, the threshold number for rolls like these are called the DC. You will use this terminology when talking about saving throws.</p>
<p>For Contested actions, in which two characters are battling and only one can succeed, their rolls are compared, and a DC is not used.</p>
<p>You might also be asked to make an ability check for a specific type of <a href="https://www.dndlounge.com/dnd-skills-5e/">skill</a>, these are called skill checks. For example, a dexterity (Sleight of hand) check is just like a normal Dexterity ability check, but if you are proficient in the Sleight of hand skill, you may add your proficiency bonus to the roll.</p>
<h4 id="saving-throws">Saving throws</h4>
<p>A saving throw represents an attempt to resist a threat. You don’t decide to make a saving throw, you are forced to if your character is at risk of harm. The modifier used in a saving throw is determined by its type, a dexterity saving throw will use the dexterity modifier. Classes also give proficiency in certain types of saving throws. If you are proficient, you may add your proficiency modifier to the throw as well. When attacking, you may have the option to force a saving throw onto your enemy, in this case, your stats dictate the DC of that throw. This formula is always listed in the class features.</p>
<h4 id="attack-rolls">Attack rolls</h4>
<p>Both attack rolls and Saving throws are used in combat. If your ability causes your opponent(s) to make a saving throw, you don’t need to make an attack roll against that target, their saving throw dictates the damage they take. Otherwise, you will be rolling an attack roll.</p>
<p>An attack roll decides weather or not an attack lands, it does not calculate damage. Attack rolls are similar to ability checks. For melee attacks, you use your strength modifier, and for ranged attacks you use your dexterity modifier. The DC of this roll is set by the AC (armor class) of the target. Every character has an AC dictated by the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/armor">armor</a> they are wearing. Don’t be fooled through, the attack roll doesn’t just choose weather or not your weapon hits armor or skin, it dictates weather or not you can land a hit on them at all. In your attack roll, you can use all modifiers available for you, including proficiency bonus if you are proficient with the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/weapons">weapon</a> you are attacking with.
If successful, you may roll for damage. Roll the die corresponding to your weapon and add the same ability modifier you used for you attack roll. That is your damage. If you rolled a 20 on your attack roll (critical hit), double the damage.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-combat">Back to combat</h2>
<p>So now we know how combat works.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dnd5e.info/combat/movement-and-position/">Move</a> up to your total walking distance at any point on your turn</li>
<li>Take as many <a href="https://dnd5e.info/combat/actions-in-combat/">actions</a> and bonus actions as your class allows</li>
<li>Make any <a href="https://roleplayersrespite.com/dnd-5e-attacks">attack rolls</a> and subsequent damage rolls as necessary</li>
<li>Make any ability or <a href="https://www.dndlounge.com/dnd-skills-5e/">skill</a> checks as your DM deems necessary for your actions</li>
</ul>
<p>If you fall to 0 hit points, you play a little minigame with the grim reaper himself. You can read about that interaction in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat">Combat</a> document</p>
<h2 id="conditions-and-damage-types">Conditions and Damage types</h2>
<p>For the final piece of the puzzle, you should have a brief understanding of damage types and conditions. Certain attacks may inflict conditions on you, limiting you actions in combat, or weakening your attacks. A list of these conditions can be found <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#content">here</a></p>
<p>Certain attacks deal different <a href="https://blackcitadelrpg.com/damage-types-5e/">types of damage</a>. You can ignore this effect unless the creature is weak to a certain type of damage. In that case, double the damage. For example, if a grass monster is weak to fire, if the attack does fire damage, you will double the damage it takes from that damage type. Similarly, if a creates resists a type of damage, it will take half.</p>
<h4 id="thats-all">Thats all</h4>
<p>Congratulations! You got through it. There are probably a few things that are not here, but this is the just of it. If you have any questions, there’s a lot of answers on the internet or I can help you as well.</p>
