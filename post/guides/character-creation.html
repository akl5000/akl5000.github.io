  <h1 id="character-creation-guide">Character Creation Guide</h1>
<p>People like to make characters in very different ways. Some enjoy creating an elaborate backstory, and choose the class and race after, while others have a class in mind and make the afterward. However, you may do it, here is a list of things that are required for a completed character.</p>
<ul>
<li>Class</li>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Background</li>
<li>Backstory</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the interconnectedness between the classes, races, and world in this homebrew, I would recommend choosing a class first, followed by race, then background. Keep careful consideration that your backstory should align with you class and race choices. Letâ€™s go over some more information about each stage of the process.</p>
<h2 id="class">Class</h2>
<p>Classes dictate what play style of combat you will have, and also some out of combat abilities like spellcasting. I have created 8 classes that exist in this world. Some have similar playstyles to existing classes while other are truly unique. One commonality between the classes is their relationship with the scales. All the classes use the scales essence to enhance their fighting abilities. Some classes gain passive or active abilities related to the scales, while other gain spellcasting abilities. Among the magic classes, only one class has the capabilities of large-scale spellcasting, while the other are just given cantrips. This is a distinction that will be described as non-magic, semi-magic, and true-magic.</p>
<p>Another important difference between my classes and typical classes is that classes are presumed to use a specific weapon or weapon type. If you choose to use a different weapon type, you will lose proficiency and your damage will decrease. Here is a short description of each class without all the flair and lore getting in the way.</p>
<h2 id="non-magic">Non-Magic</h2>
<h4 id="assassin">Assassin</h4>
<p><a href="/post/classes/assassin.html">Assassin</a> is very similar to the rogue class in DND. They have capabilities for large bursts of damage and great escape tools, with proficiency in throwing weapons and a short sword. Assassins can come in 3 different styles, each with different capabilities and playstyles. The styles are separated by the three assassin guilds across the continent. If you plan to play an assassin, your backstory should account for your current or past membership in one of these guilds.</p>
<h4 id="blademaster">Blademaster</h4>
<p>The <a href="/post/classes/blademaster.html">Blademaster</a> is loosely based off of the barbarian in DND. It has high health totals and can output lots of damage after entering a state similar to rage. The more distinguishing trait of the Blade Master is its dual wielding. The class and all of its abilities are tailored to this weapon type. As you grow stronger, more and more attacks can be used in a single turn, causing your damage output to skyrocket. This class is for people to attack in a frenzy at the front lines, with access to many different variations of attacks.</p>
<h4 id="ranger">Ranger</h4>
<p>The <a href="/post/classes/ranger.html">Ranger</a> is a bow only class, bearing no relation to the DND class Ranger. As you become stronger, many of the limitations of a bow in typical DND get removed, casing the damage to be pretty good for a long-range playstyle. It is not comparable to any class in DND, as all the abilities are tailored around using a ranged weapon. You eventually gain access to essence infused ammunition and multishot. You also gain access to Focused shots, allowing you to do ridiculous things with a bow like disarming people.</p>
<h4 id="militant">Militant</h4>
<p>The <a href="/post/classes/militant.html">Militant</a> is a class that only uses spear like weapons. It is most likely the most complex class I have created, with access to a load of abilities at a fairly low level, and multiple paths you can take while you level up. Under my calculations, it has a large damage spike at lower levels, and maintains its utility by providing many different types of skills useful for lots of situations. The class revolves around a combo like playstyle, forcing you to plan multiple turns ahead to optimize damage. All characters choosing this class should have a relationship to the military of a kingdom, as only the military learn this fighting style.</p>
<h2 id="semi-magic">Semi-Magic</h2>
<h4 id="brutalist">Brutalist</h4>
<p>The <a href="/post/classes/brutalist.html">Brutalist</a> class is the closest I have to a Monk/Unarmed combat class. The monk uses no weapons, but instead uses their fists and essence powers. The Brutalist is kind of hardcore, they infuse the essence directly into their bloodstream under a rigorous training period in the wilderness. Your backstory should take this into account. There are two types of Brutalists, one focuses on support and healing, while the other outputs massive damage with aoe and destructive palm strikes. No matter your choice, the Brutalist learns all of their abilities before level 20, turning them into a powerhouse of healing and destruction.</p>
<h4 id="swordsman">Swordsman</h4>
<p>The <a href="/post/classes/swordsman.html">Swordsman</a> is a typical Magic Swordsman, which is not a typical class in DND. They only have access to cantrips which is why they are in this category, but they also may choose between 3 swordsmanship schools, each with their own essence infused sword techniques. The swordsman is a good class if you want to play a fairly normal sword class, with the opportunity to cast small spells, but also output massive destructive sword techniques. If you choose this class, you must incorporate your attendance of a sword school into your past.</p>
<h4 id="soundsmith">Soundsmith</h4>
<p><a href="/post/classes/soundsmith.html">Soundsmith</a> is a better bard. You have a similar inspiration mechanic to the bard class in DND, but also gain access to cantrips, and strong abilities that give negative conditions to your opponents. This class is the ultimate buff to your party. At later levels, you gain the ability to damage your enemies purely through sound, destroying their mind. This class is a great addition to your party, but just be mentally prepared to use am instrument as your primary weapon for a while.</p>
<h2 id="true-magic">True-Magic</h2>
<h4 id="beggar">Beggar</h4>
<p>The <a href="/post/classes/beggar.html">Beggar</a> is best described as a mixture between the wizard and warlock, with a truly unique design. As a beggar, you are a penniless, stoic, sage, living on the streets and dedicated to the understanding and mastery of the scales. You gain access to all the magic in this world over time. If you like spellcasting, then this is the class for you. Just remember, you canâ€™t really be a beggar if your backstory involves you being a noble, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h2 id="race">Race</h2>
<p>After selecting a class, you should begin forming some ideas about the background of your character, and how they fell into the specific combat style you chose. To fill in the last piece of the puzzle, you need to choose a <a href="/tags/races/">race</a>. Each race not only has a region of the map they call their homeland, but also racial abilities to aid you in your adventure.</p>
<p>You may enjoy choosing a race based on your willingness to play a character with those specific characteristics, or you may be passionate about one of the racial abilities. Whatever it is, make sure you feel comfortable playing in that character. For example, if you want to play as the Blood-Touched only because of the blood magic trait, you have to also come to terms that you will be mistreated in many parts of the continent. You will have to deal with the red markings on your body, and of course, you will have to write your backstory growing up as a person of that race.</p>
<p>In my opinion, choose a race not for their abilities, but one that you will feel comfortable playing as. For many of you, humans will be moist natural, it might be hard to get into character if you are purple colored. As someone who designed all this, the racial abilities arenâ€™t that powerful compared to the classes, so donâ€™t feel disappointed to leave behind a cool ability. It is more important for you to feel comfortable roleplaying as someone of the race you choose than for you to get the ability you think are cool.</p>
<p>The pages for each race are descriptive and worth to read, learn about the races <a href="/tags/races.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>After choosing a class and race you should be feeling confident about what kind of person you want to play as. The last choice is your background. For many, a background can be chosen easily by choosing the one suggested in the quick build of each class description. For example, it would make sense to choose the Soldier background for the Militant, they come from the military anyway. Others can be chosen of course if they fit well in your backstory. A full list of backgrounds can be found Here. Feel free to consult with me with help making your background fit. It is not the biggest deal if none do, I can always make on up to fit with the world better.</p>
<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>This is the most important part of your character. There are a few misconceptions when it comes to backstories, and I will try to address them here, so nobody gets stressed out about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good backstories are neither a paragraph nor 3 pages. They contain enough information for you to know who your character is as a person. A backstory is a reminder to yourself who this person is, and how you, who is embodying their essence, would make decisions as them.</li>
<li>Backstory creation is a collaborative process between me and you. You will decide who you want to be in this world, and I can help your ideas fit into this world better. I have more information about this world then you have access to on this website, it is your best interest that your character mends together with this world as best as you can.</li>
<li>Alignments actually do not play any part in the combat system or interactions in DND 5e. You do not need to worry about choosing one. If anything, your true alignment will come out in your actions and decisions in the story. Making a choice preemptively will lock you in and may be something that frustrates you down the line.</li>
<li>Finally, do not make a character to impress your friends. Do not make a character that is extremely different than yourself. The easiest character to play in DND is yourself. Now of course, you will not be playing as yourself, but the closer your character is in terms of core values, ways they interact, ways of talking, and past experiences, the easier they will be to play, and the more fun you will have playing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that Iâ€™ve got some things out of the way, I can make your guys feel some pressure about this whole character creation thing. (Sorry in advance, I just put a lot of work into this and I want to make sure things run smoothly in this department).</p>
<p>You want to make a character such that every week you become excited to continue their adventure, to see what places they go next, what people they meet in the next town. Your character is an extension of yourself. Your character is your existence in this world, and you will hopefully become attached to them. Their memories will become yours as the game progresses. Give your character a lot of thought. Do not make them a bloody murderer if you donâ€™t want to murder everyone you find. Do not make your character a female if you donâ€™t want to act like a female forever. Do not make a character deeply loyal if you want to betray people. Do not make a character you will regret playing, or dread playing.</p>
<p>There is a Quote from Brendan lee Mulligan â€“ â€œCharacters are translucent and not opaque. They are like stained glass. You the person are the light behind the stained glass. The character you create are still you, but the colors and shapes on the glass make the light shine through differently.</p>
<p>Are you prepared mentally to take on the role of your character? You have to cast yourself into the role of the character you create and be honest with yourself. Dark and dreary backstories full of tragedy are cool, but is that really who you want to be acting as? That essence will reflect back onto you. If you have to play each week as a depressed asshole, not only will you have to be a depressed asshole in a game where we are trying to enjoy ourselves, but the people at the table will have to play with a depressed asshole when they are trying to have fun. Wild characters like those may be a fun gag for a few sessions, but over time they become a nuisance.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve heard some things about making a character crazy, or chaotic, or evil, or an asshole, etc. It is ok to be a little bit crazy, everyone is, but please put more thought into your character then binary character traits. Do not make a character that would cause the other players enjoy your characters death. And most importantly, please make your character willing to join a party and adventure. Thatâ€™s the point of the game.</p>
<p>If everyone is committed, attentive, and actually cares about their character and the other characters around the table, I promise, this game can make you feel like you are living in a movie, and I want that for everyone.
Ok now for some tips if you are struggling.</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is something your character truly cares about</li>
<li>What is something your character regrets</li>
<li>What are your characters goals or purpose in the world</li>
<li>Why does your character want to join a party, what purpose do they have adventuring.</li>
<li>What is something that will make your character angry</li>
<li>What is something that will make your character heartbroken if lost</li>
<li>What are your characters proudest moments</li>
<li>What are your characters most loved possessions</li>
</ul>
<p>I know these seem like lame questions, but, coming from some of the best DMâ€™s out there, having answers to these questions will make your character fuller and more alive than many people can do in a 3-page backstory. Keep in mind, it might be cool and easy for you if your character has no possessions, no regrets, and just wants to vibe, but that character is a shell. What purpose do they have, they have reached nirvana at that point!</p>
<p>Having these questions answered will make playing your character easier. If you know their goals and values, decisions will become easier in the adventure. If you know what they want to protect, you will know that your character will get upset if said things are destroyed, etc.</p>
<p>Good Luck, talk with me if you have any questions!</p>
