  <h1 id="history-of-eribar">History of Eribar</h1>
<p>The history of the Eribar can be divided up into 3 periods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ancient era (AE)</li>
<li>Chaos State</li>
<li>Post-Chaos (PC)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ancient-era">Ancient era</h2>
<p>The ancient era can be best described in sub-eras. As much of the history of this time was lost in the Chaos State, only large-scale events were remembered. For this reason, only rough estimates of dates are known.</p>
<h4 id="pre-discovery">Pre-Discovery</h4>
<p>During this time, settlements were few and far between, with most creatures hunting and creating small scale farms to survive. A settlement along the bay of stasis seemed to be the largest civilized community at the time for the humans. Not much was known about the spirit beasts during this time, it is best estimated that they did not know about the existence of the other races either and therefore stayed to the south. The Azzar kept to small civilizations in the northwestern taiga, interacting sparsely with humans, and maintaining peaceful relations.</p>
<h4 id="great-awakening">Great Awakening</h4>
<p>The great awakening marks the moment in the history of Eribar when the power of the scales was first discovered. Previously to this point, all except a few scales were undiscovered. The space scale was being recognized by the Azzar as a divine deity, the Wood scale was discovered by a group of wanderers, who set up a small encampment, and the Dark Scale was stumbled upon by a nearby village. After the discovery of these scales, tales of inhuman prowess started spreading, leading more and more people to these locations. As the knowledge of the scales were limited, the inhabitants of the continent tried everything to gain the rumored power. Eventually, the people who physically touched the scales, often sleeping next to them for days, became infused with their essence. With their newfound power, these people became warlords and saints, leading legions of people and embodying gods.</p>
<h4 id="the-search">The Search</h4>
<p>Once information about these empowered creatures spread around the continent, a frenzy to find more of these scales took place. Of course, the empowered creatures had the largest advantage in finding every scale, promising their followers power in return for results. Over the next few years, transportation networks, towns, and people spread across the continent in a great outward expansion backed by the empowered beings. Eventually, all the scales were found, and the most rigorous searchers became empowered under their leader’s protection.</p>
<h4 id="the-heavenly-three">The Heavenly three</h4>
<p>Three people stood a overlooking the world, with the full powers of the scales at their behalf. Three people with the power to destroy anyone who they despised. Either with the powers they commanded, or the legions they controlled.</p>
<h4 id="ukrar-and-the-immortal-army">Ukrar and the Immortal army</h4>
<p>Ukrar Kilmin was a Human born in the forests of Abre and a discoverer of the Wood scale. Ukrar was the sole member of the wanderers who physically touched the scale. After touching the scale, Ukrar found himself healing his wounds faster. Realizing things changed withing him after finding the scale, he went back to study it further. Over the next year, Ukrar imbued himself with the Wood essence, and gave himself the ability to heal others. Ukrar became a profit a legend among nearby villages, amassing a devoted following. Those who dared to challenge his authority were welcomed with a fight. He challenged all who defied his reign to challenge him in a bathe of strength, which, due to the scales power, he never lost. Suspecting the existence of more divine objects like the scale he discovered, Ukrar sent his followers on a mission to find more foreign objects. Over the course of the search, Ukrar, along with his followers, gained control over the Wood Scale, Control Scale, and Rage Scale. Ukrar’s legion became known as the Immortal army, as Ukrar himself, after dominating his subordinates in training, would heal their wounds with the power of the Wood Scale.</p>
<h4 id="lica-gamwich-and-the-shadow-legion">Lica Gamwich and the Shadow Legion</h4>
<p>Lica Gamwich is a Human born and orphaned in the village of Ethyst, a small fishing village on the north of the great basin. She discovered the Dark scale along with other fishmen of the village in a fishing expedition gone awry. While the fishermen were frightened by its presence, Lica took great interest in the scale. Lica hid from the fishermen attempting to return to the village and stuck with the Scale. After sleeping next to the scale for many nights, she understood the power she had discovered. With her body and mind imbued with the Dark essence, Lica traveled back to the village, and slaughtered everyone there, in fear of someone taking the power away from her. After spending many more days alone with the scale, she finally ventured back into society and learned the search was underway. Recognizing her role in the upcoming continental change, she ventured into the Agawrathe desert, in hopes she would find something somewhere no humans have dared to venture yet. Lica felt the calling of a scale as she approached the mountains and found the Fire scale awaiting her. After learning the secrets of the second scale, she covered the scale in illusion and ventured west, back to civilization. With her newfound abilities consisting of two different types of essence, the people of the continent recognized her as the strongest warrior in the land, following her judgement. With the support of her followers, she was lucky enough to be gifted the Water scale on the cost of lake Zara by a supporter of Ukrar, who left him to serve the more powerful Lica. With three scales hidden under her illusion arts, and a devoted legion of power-hungry citizens, her forces became known as the Shadow Legion.</p>
<h4 id="at-gar-and-the-great-alliance">At-Gar and The Great Alliance</h4>
<p>At-Gar Barka, an Azzar Born in the unnamed northwestern taiga, in the current region of Yicherkin, discovered the Space Scale alone. He became obsessed with the scale, studying it for years. After returning to Azzarian society long after they believed him to be dead, he showed them immense power, and of course, showed them the space between worlds. At-Gar rallied his clansman, and eventually, the entire race to the scale, worshipping the divine power it gave them. The scale imbued the race with its essence, and the race was content. On the other side of the continent, the search for the scales caused the Spirit beasts to occupy both the Earth and Metal scales in the south, allowing a great Beast to be empowered, Sojar Halo, a White Tiger. Wanting to expand their influence farther into Eribar, Sojar and the Spirit beasts challenged At-Gar and the Azzars to a duel for control over the scales. Underestimating the Azzars, Sojar was defeated by At-gar on the beaches of current day Yichekin and was exiled into the void. With the loss of a continental force, The Azzars Took control over the southern continent, securing both the Metal and Earth scales, and welcoming the spirit beasts into their forces. This multiracial force became known as the Great Alliance.</p>
<h4 id="scales-tipped">Scales tipped</h4>
<p>With the death of Sojar, the faction leaders realized a war would break out, and shared their teachings and access to the scales power to as many worth people they could find, leading to armies of imbued warriors. At this point, more people than ever had control over the scales power, lead by the three most dangerous people on the continent. A war was coming.</p>
<h2 id="the-chaos-state">The Chaos State</h2>
<p>Not much is known from the chaos state regarding the specific battles and tactics used during this period, but a few legendary battles and events are still passed down as legends to this day.</p>
<h4 id="the-great-split">The Great Split</h4>
<p>The Shadow legion was being attacked by the upward invasion of the central continent by the Spirit beasts in the south. The Shadow legion speculated that the Spirit beasts in the South would attempt to capture the water scale so that the great alliance would have control over the entire western continent. The legion set their first line of defense along the Misty Mountains, giving a tactical advantage over the Beasts. The Alliances warriors crossed the Pekin strait and began their siege. After a multi-day battle, which resulted in a stalemate, The Alliance leader, At-Gar, visited the battlefield personally. The master of the space scale, At-gar, exiled not just the enemy encampment, but the mountain range itself. In the wake of his single movement, the battle was lost for the Shadow legion. The division in the mountain range is still present today and is named the great split. At the same time, internal disputes within the immortal army begun in the opposite corner of the continent.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-blood-touched">The First Blood-Touched</h4>
<p>The first Blood-touched was created during the chaos state. The master of the Rage scale, and kings knight to Ukrar, Hanna Ziirae, was the first to leave their humanity behind. Jealous of the power of Ukrar and enraged that she was not able to obtain the purest essence from the rage scale, her understanding of the rage essence inside her grew purer than anyone else. The scale recognized her rage and granted power in exchange for her blood. Hanna underwent a transformation, undergoing a torturous bone and muscle reconstruction that took weeks. Afterward, a blast of essence emanated from her body, imbuing many warriors stationed at the rage scale with the same modified rage essence. Each one of them developed the characteristic red skin patterns we see today. Of these warriors who survived the war, their future generations continued having the same blood red skin patterns and oddly colored eyes. Because of their unique nonhuman characteristics and their special relation to blood and the rage scale, a distinction was made, separating these creatures from the rest of humankind, labeling them Blood-Touched, and casting them out in fear.</p>
<h4 id="the-blood-fields">The Blood Fields</h4>
<p>Ukrar, enraged at his knight Hanna’s betrayal, took matters into his own hands choose to kill Hanna and the blood-touched himself. A great battle, undenounced to the powers of the continent, took place between the leader of the immortal army and the Blood-Touched traitor. In the Northeast corner of the continent, the two exchanged blows for a single day. The outraged Ukrar inhibited qualities of a master of the rage scale, only for his skills to be overshadowed by the controlled aggression of his opponent. The only thing known about this fight is the massive handprints left on the soil of the taiga, almost 5 feet deep, wounding the natural beauty of the Blood-Fields. Ukrar, so engrossed in his rage, lost consciousness and his connection to the wood scale, soon falling to his defeat by the overpowering force of the rage’s essence. As an aftereffect of the battle, the rage infused blood spilled by Hanna coated the ground in the modified essence. Over the next decade, the unused essence imbued its only hosts, the plants in which it was spilled on, and coated the unnatural palm prints of the taiga with blood-colored flowers, giving the region its name.</p>
<h4 id="desperate-assault">Desperate Assault</h4>
<p>The now leaderless Immortal army, with a sever lack of immortal power, led their desperate assault on the two other factions. Unknowing to who their leader had been defeated by, the remnants of the immortal army led their forces to capture the nearest scale to vent their anger. The army approached the fire scale in the agawrathe mountains, only to be met by the Shadow army on the dunes of the Agawrathe desert. Not to be conquered by a headless army, The Shadow Queen herself appeared on the front lines, making quick work of the demoralized army.</p>
<h4 id="unknown-foe">Unknown Foe</h4>
<p>After this assault, the forces of the continent were confused. Would this defeat create a standoff between the Shadow legion and the Great Alliance or would the Shadow Legion gain control over the Scales of the north, pushing the balance of power over the limit. Anticipating the capture of Wood and Rage scale by Lica, Hanna preemptively captured the wood scale and made the order for a sneak attack on the Legions forces at the wood scale.</p>
<p>The attack was successful, and Lica was caught by surprise. With limited information, and a loss of enough of the shadow legion to tip the balance, Lica asked to join the Great alliance to combat the unknown foe. While joining the alliance was a step back in the Shadow Queens plans, the loss of forces warranted a change of strategy, as being attacked by both sides would end up as a loss in the war. While Lica was officially accepted into the alliance, her animosity towards it remained, and her motives would become clear after the unknown foe was defeated.</p>
<h4 id="the-uncanny-end">The Uncanny end</h4>
<p>The final battle of the chaos state was held to the north of the Fire scale, at no particular encampment or town, but the location where the two forces met, on the east side of the northern Agawrathe mountains. Hanna and the Blood-Touched met the Great Alliance in battle. A weeklong battle ensured, with each side taking heavy losses. While the Great alliance held a more diverse set of essence, the pure rage essence and blood manipulation from the Blood-Touched gave the Alliance trouble. The Blood-Touched desired a battle of attrition, and they were granted it.</p>
<p>The two armies and three godly beings were present on the battlefield, and it would be the last place they would be seen. A party of 12 including warriors and scouts were sent to gather information on the Blood-Touched, leaving the battlefield to perform a wide flank on their encampment. When they completed their maneuver, the camp was empty, and the Blood-Touched nowhere to be found. Backtracking towards the point between the two armies, a large, clean-cut crater was discovered void of all forces. With no survivors, the outcome of the final battle was lost to the silence of death, and the continent slowly relaxed itself in the aftermath.</p>
<p>After the battle ended, the small powers of the continent scrambled to pick up the ruins. Most knowledge was lost in the final battle, meaning many of the techniques that lead to the empowerment of humans were lost. But the races of the continent knew that they must seal the scales away forever. A treaty was signed to limit access to the scales everywhere, and an alliance of 9 kingdoms were created, each securing a scale.</p>
<h2 id="post-chaos">Post-Chaos</h2>
<p>The 9 kingdoms stood their ground, maintaining order in the new age. Each kingdom put all their effort into protecting the scales from the public. In the decades after the chaos state, many power-hungry individuals attempted to break open the kingdoms grasp, but every time they were unsuccessful, as the combined strength of the 9 kingdoms was far too great for any individual to bear. Many assumed that the power of the scales was to be locked up forever, but generation passed, and the power of the scales could not be contained as the kingdoms once thought.</p>
<p>By growing up in one of the 9 capital cities, people became naturally imbued with a weaker form of essence, resonating outward through any barriers the kingdoms could erect. With the newfound power granted to people everywhere, and the deterrent of the equally empowered kingdoms, attempts to gain the greater power of the scales lessened. But, as the essence continued to emanate, the power level of those who studied it began to rise.</p>
<p>A century passed and the treaty of the kingdoms started to lose meaning. People were satisfied with the radiant essence flowing through their cities, and the kingdoms realized that. While the tradition of protection held strong in all capital cities, their focus shifted outward, and as all kingdoms do over time, they became greedy. Over the next century, no kingdoms were bold enough to take control of another scale, in fear of another great war, but disputes over territory became common.</p>
<p>Aghur, home of the Dark scale, being particularly inept at politics, quickly lost control over much of the Hills of Lidrae. Zara and Malia gained control over much of the northern part of the Hills with not much resistance from Aghur. Due to the nature of Aghur as a trading city, no kingdom dared to touch the city itself, and Aghur was content with what it had left.</p>
<p>Varamu, the spire protecting the control Scale, created an alliance with the Agarin empire, protecting itself from the rest of the kingdoms. Because their lands are particularly sheltered by the agawrathe mountains, the Sicrin plains and the Varamu spire became the safest lands on the continent, sheltered from the territory disputes that plagued the rest of the continent.</p>
<p>At-Mekin, the city of the Space scale, make barricaded themselves in the northwest corner of the continent. As only one small land bridge connects them to thew rest of the continent, very few kingdoms dare to challenge their control. While the essence of the space scale is particularly valuable, no kingdom has dared to risk their forces on such disadvantaged siege.</p>
<p>The other kingdoms of the continent are locked in stalemate. Small changes of territory are common, but the people living on the city lines are used to this lifestyle by now. some kingdoms are in small, petty like feuds with each other like Aneric Confederation and the kingdom of Bivalla, while other disputes are filled with long lasting grudges, stretching back to the chaos state. The City of Malia comes to mind, while content with its position in the south, still holds grudges with the Blood-Touched capital city, Majma.</p>
