  <h1 id="welcome-to-the-world-of-eribar">Welcome to the world of Eribar!</h1>
<p>You will soon play in this world, so I can’t give out all its secrets, but I can give you worldly knowledge that almost everyone living on the continent knows.</p>
<h3 id="foreign-objects">Foreign objects</h3>
<p>The Continent of Eribar is home to 9 mythical objects called scales. Each scale is roughly the size of a 2-story house. The scales are hard as diamonds, slightly reflective, and warm to the touch. Each scale is dark, like peering into an abyss. The only differing quality is a faint coloration when light is reflected off, forming a sort of aura around the scales surface. The scales radiate 9 different colors, ranging from red to blue to purple to white. Yet these scales are not named after their color, they are named from after their essence.</p>
<p>Shortly after these scales were discovered, creatures of the continent noticed a power radiating through their body after enough time spent around the scales. It was learned that these massive artifacts emanate a power source in which they named essence. The races of the continent found many ways to draw the essence from the scales into their own body. Some found that talking certain medicinal herbs while near the scale allowed more essence to be transferred, while other found that meditating or sleeping near the scale worked as well. The scales were named after the type of essence they resonated: Wood for the green scale, Fire for the orange scale, Earth for the yellow scale, Metal for the white scale, Water for the blue scale, Space for the purple scale, Rage for the red scale, Control for the teal scale, and Dark for the black scale.</p>
<p>The first people who grasped the essence swirling inside themselves found a power unheard of before. The essence had the ability to grant power beyond a physical limit. People imbued their weapons with essence, leading to powerful and destructive clashes between superhumans. People imbued essence into their own flesh and blood, studying the flow of essence within them, and flushing it out to pour destructive energy out of their pores. Battles were gruesome and lengthy, with the essence keeping people on the brink of death for weeks on end. The major powers of the continent realized that the scales were a strategic resource meant to be fought over, and with tensions rising, war was soon to come.</p>
<p>After many years of battle which is know today as the chaos state, kingdoms formed borders, hiding the scales behind fortifications. A bloody treaty was signed, banning the empowerment of creatures by the scales direct influence. Proximity to the scales in present day is limited, but the essence still flows through us all. What the treaty couldn’t stop, was the will of the scales, and the scales wanted to be heard. The largest cities on the continent are those who formed to protect a scale. Citizens of those cities live alongside the essence in the air, becoming imbued with the essence of the scales over time. All adventures use the scales essence in their abilities. Combat is still aided by the scale’s essence, but it is nowhere near the power of the chaos state.</p>
<h3 id="diverse-climates-and-cultures">Diverse Climates and Cultures</h3>
<p>Eribar is a diverse continent home to many different types of forests, lakes, deserts, and mountains. From the dry Agawrathe mountains to the Riven Jungle in the south, the Continent of Eribar sports a wide variety of climates alongside a wide variety of people and cultures.</p>
<p>The Yichekin Region in the north-west is home to the Azzar, a proud race dedicated to protecting the mystical Space scale. A large tundra stretches over the entire land mass of the Yichekin region. With only one small land bridge to the resto of the continent, interactions between the Azzar and the other races are limited, and it is rare to see someone who has imbued themselves with the power of the space scale on the mainland.</p>
<p>The Scattered Lakes region is in the West side of the mainland and is inhabited by mostly humans. It is best known for its largest body of water, Lake Zara, and the city home to the Water scale, named after the lake, the city of Zara. This region is lush and fertile, while also being home to 2 small mountain ranges. The mountains to the north are called the Ester mountains, and the mountains to the south of Lake Zara are called The Misty Mountains. These mountains in particular are hit by a great amount of rainfall due to the location of Lake Zara to the north.</p>
<p>The Hills of Lidrae is the central region of Eribar and is inhabited by humans. It encompasses the least coastline and consists of the upper portion of the Agawrathe mountains and the hilly planes of the central continent. Near the bottom of the region lies Aghur, the capital of crime and home to the dark scale. Aghur is home to many criminal guilds as well as one of the most powerful Assassin guilds on the continent. Despite of that, or perhaps directly because if it, Aghur is the most prolific trade city on the continent. Set in the middle of 5 other major cities, as well as ocean access via the pekin strait, almost every good passes through their trade hub.</p>
<p>The Agawrathe Mountains are the largest range of mountains on the continent. In the middle of the range, a large arid desert, full of red sand, separates the lower and upper half of the mountain range. In the middle of this desert, propped up against a tall spire of a mountain, is the city of Agarin, home of the Fire scale. While this region is dry and infertile, exports of metals and precious gems keep the economy booming. Humans live in this territory, but sometimes land in the south is disputed by the spirit bests in the marsh below.</p>
<p>The Sicrin Plains are situated in the eastern part of the continent, with the Agawrathe mountains blocking their peaceful land from the rest of the continent. The plains are home to a number of pastoral human tribes under the protection of the Spire of Varamu. Varamu is a large spire constructed by masters of essence during the chaos state. It still stands to this day and protects the control scale with its might.</p>
<p>The Blood-Fields are home to one of the more misjudged races in Eribar, the Blood-Touched. Despite their rough history, the Blood fields is actually not a misnomer. A large battle took place between two great foes during the chaos state in this region, causing many patches of wasteland among the scattered taigas. Red flowers happened to thrive in these patches, giving name to the region. Majma, the city who holds power over the Rage scale is not a welcome place to outsiders. Only the blood-touched can feel safe in this city, but who can complain, it might be the only place on the continent the blood-touched can call home.</p>
<p>The Silver Marsh is home to the eastern spirit beast population. Many of the reptile or bear spirit beasts are native to this area. The marsh region stretches along the coast of the inner basin, eventually reaching the city of Bivalla, home of the earth scale. Bivalla is the definition of a port city, who keeps their pockets full via trade from both Aghur to the north and the Aneric confederacy to the West.</p>
<p>The riven jungle is a dense patch of jungle that is located in the southwest of Eribar. This region is the homeland of most cat, monkey, and tiger spirit beasts, along with many dangerous jungle terrors. On the coast of the inner basin lies the Aneric confederacy. A peaceful Spirit beast kingdom striving to create peace along the continent. They protect the Metal scale, and in turn, have a long history of battle worn heroes.</p>
<h3 id="a-continent-in-balance">A Continent in balance</h3>
<p>Eribar is home to four distinct races each with their own history and claims across the continent. At the present moment, there is peace between the races. That isn’t to say however, that there is peace between the kingdoms. Apart from the blood-touched, who may find discrimination around the continent due to their past deeds, races are welcome in all kingdoms. Most cities who have control over the scales power have developed themselves into continental superpowers, with eyes on each other’s land. There are a few exceptions, however.</p>
<p>Aghur, the city of the Dark scale has remained neutral through the many territory disputes between nations. While they do not have the greatest military force, kingdoms across Eribar would rather not jeopardize the relation they have with the city as a great trading partner and forgo access to the other side of the continent via trade. Because of this, and the threat of assassin guilds holding grudges, Aghur has remained neutral.</p>
<p>The spire of Varamu, the impenetrable fortress, and the safeguard of the Sicrin plains, has opted out of the political battlefield. Surrendering yourself out of the battle leaves you sticking out like a sore thumb in the continent of Eribar, so the council of elders at the top of Varamu made this decision wisely. Varamu made an alliance with the kingdom of Agarin, promising not to attack them under promise of protection by them and the mountains. Agarin, who would rather face the enemy on one side, not two, opted to take this deal, protecting Varamu from the dangers of the continent.</p>
<p>The city of At-Mekin, land of the Azzar and home of the Space scale is a valuable asset to the kingdoms of Eribar. Fortunately for both sides, the Azzar have no intention on expansion into the mainland, and the land bridge between the two lands is too much of a tactical disadvantage to attack into. This, and the fact that At-Mekin is landlocked, means that much to the chagrin of the kingdoms of the mainland, The city of the space scale is too difficult to take, and thus is a stalemate.
The rest of the kingdoms of the continent are in stalemate in current times, but grudges and feud last for centuries, and the people of Eribar feel war in the air.</p>
<h3 id="haven-for-adventurers">Haven for Adventurers.</h3>
<p>You join this world in a time of peace, but any tip of the scales could change that fact. For adventurers however, this is a blessing. Almost every city on the map will willingly accept wanderers of any race into their borders, as any strong persons are welcome during times of war. Warriors and wanders alike have never before been able to experience the essence of the scales in such variety before. Will you place yourself in the battle between kingdoms? Or perhaps become legends among the people across the continent.</p>
