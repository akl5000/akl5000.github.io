  <h1 id="the-major-cities-of-eribar">The Major Cities of Eribar</h1>
<p>After the Chaos State, 9 major cities sprung from the ashes to protect the scale&rsquo;s power from the world. Each city is unique and plays its own role in the current age.</p>
<h3 id="zara-water">Zara (Water)</h3>
<p>Stationed on the reef of the continent’s largest lake, Zara is a city of wealth and intellectuals. Peaked white spires can be seen rising up through the metropolis. The city is known not just for its immense wealth brought by the large costal trade networks spanning across land and sea, but also its large industrial hub, market districts, and large parties for the elite. The city was founded because of the water scale, and gatekeeps its greatest powers from the public.</p>
<p>The Zarian military sports some of the most well-trained Spearmen and bowmen on the continent. Realizing the significance of a well-trained army, the Zarian elite prioritize learning spear or bow arts, and eventually joining the renowned corps of the Zarian Military. Because of this, some of the most powerful techniques for these weapons originate from the Zarian people and the water scale.</p>
<h3 id="maila-wood">Maila (wood)</h3>
<p>The Kingdom of Maila sits in a quant patch of forest above the Agawrathe mountains in the northern Forests of Abre. A large agriculture industry has sprouted in the region, Allowing Maila to become quite wealthy, but the residents don’t flaunt this wealth. Instead, they use their resources to limit development and protect the beauty of the forest, balancing what they give and take. Any person who studies the wood scale understands that its essence flows through all wilderness, and the people of Maila have chosen to respect the scales wishes and live alongside nature.</p>
<p>One might think that living without development might make you soft, but the warriors of Maila know different. They know that when nature receives protection, it returns the favor, and that a malleable tree can withstand more than something built from lifeless planks.</p>
<h3 id="agarin-fire">Agarin (fire)</h3>
<p>Nestled deep inside the sharp peaks of the Agawrathe mountains, the cave city of Agarin hides itself. Inside a massive cavern stretching far beneath the mountain range, thousands of houses lie, piled over each other in a mess of odd shapes, fitting together strangely. Hidden in the chaotic environment is a labyrinth of stairs, paths, and tunnels, connecting each home together, organized in a way only locals can follow. Deep withing the caverns, away from the populous, is the fire scale, hidden away from the world under a mass of stone.</p>
<p>The Agarin empire is responsible for gathering the metals and precious gems for the continent. Trade networks spiral out of this neutral city, stretching out to every corner of the continent. Not only is this city the perfect location for this business, but it is also almost impossible to siege, making protecting its resources trivial.</p>
<h3 id="bivalla-earth">Bivalla (Earth)</h3>
<p>The Kingdom of Bivalla lies in the Silver Marsh, on the coast of the Great basin, south of the Agawrathe Mountains. Within sight of the city are the Islands of Ocmore, a set of small to medium sized islands where much of the Spirit Beast population lives. Because of the large numbers of aquatic life near the islands, and their proximity to the city, the islands give the kingdom of Bivalla a large fishing market. The city is controlled by a family of Boar Spirit beasts, bulky warriors who lead the forces of Bivalla into battle.</p>
<p>The city is also home to the most prestigious medicinal clan on the continent, producing some of the foulest poisons and heavenly doctors in Eribar. The ruling family recognized this unique gift to the city and have invested much of their capital into the Import of medicinal resources and export of elixirs. Of course, the king did not support the export of poisons, but the market cannot stop demand, and much of the poison imports to Aughur can be traced back to this city.</p>
<h3 id="aneric-metal">Aneric (Metal)</h3>
<p>The Aneric Confederacy is controlled by an elected council of people from every race on Eribar. The city rests on the coast of the great basin, just outside the tangle of the Riven Jungle. The metal Scale resides in this city, under protection by the council and hidden from public eye. Large walls protect the city from naval assault, and the thick jungle to its back deters many from venturing far out from the city. Because of this, the city is highly developed, and offers luxuries for its mostly Spirit Beast population.</p>
<p>The city is most well-known for its blacksmith’s guild, as the essence of the metal scale has aided many skilled craftsmen in their craft. While the city doesn’t export much weaponry, skilled warriors from all over the continent come to the Aneric Confederacy in search of a master blacksmith to forge a fitted weapon.</p>
<h3 id="majmarage">Majma(rage)</h3>
<p>In the heart of the blood fields, a city stands its ground against all oppressors. Majma, protector of the rage scale, and home of the Blood-Touched, persists. Majma acts as the haven of the Blood-Touched and is one of the only places on the continent where their red markings can be showed freely and proudly. While the Blood-Touched are outcast in other parts of the continent, the same sentiment is not always true, and other races can also be seen living in Majma, attracted to the pure power the Scale’s essence can grant them.</p>
<p>An arena stands tall as the centerpiece of Majma, making spectacles of criminals and those who have lost their mind in rage. In this city power dictates everything, and it is not uncommon to see powerful leaders rise out of the arena’s bouts. But all blood touched know, while the strong survive, it is the survivor who survives to become stronger.</p>
<h3 id="varamu-control">Varamu (Control)</h3>
<p>The council of elders perched at the top of the tower of Varamu keeps an unwavering watch over the Sycrin plains. The tower presents itself as a beacon for the people of the plains, and many choose to live in its shadow. The Control scale is hidden underneath the tower, guarded in its dungeons, but the appeal of the tower is not what’s underneath, its what’s at the top. The most powerful warriors of the continent rise up the tower’s floors after each bout, with each additional floor holding more information and strength.</p>
<p>Warriors of the continent look up to the tower in awe of its legacy and resolve themselves to climb its floors. People who have gained access to the upper floors of this tower are continental forces. Often, these warriors would use their floor status to become recognized and respected around the continent. Others offer their service and connections as mercenaries, with the ability to turn the tide of a battle.</p>
<h3 id="aghur-dark">Aghur (Dark)</h3>
<p>Located on the coast of the great basin, and centrally to the wealthiest cities on the continent, Aghur maintains its boarders. Aghur is neither a wealthy nor prosperous city, but it maintains its role as a trading district central to the kingdoms of the continent. While merchants use this city as a welcome trading partner, criminal organizations, pirates, and bandits plague this city in abundance.</p>
<p>Aghur has two faces, a welcoming port city, and the capital of crime. All criminals know of the crime lords who rule the underground, and almost no information escapes the informants only a select few know of. While criminals rule the streets, the dark scale maintains its illusiveness, locked away within the city’s borders.</p>
<h3 id="at-mekin-space">At-Mekin (Space)</h3>
<p>Shrouded by the massive pine trees of the north, At-Mekin is a strange metropolis, spreading like a web away from its cornerstone, the Space scale. A large pyramid, stronger than diamond and blacker than darkness itself encases the scale, as a remnant from the chaos state. The Azzar dominate this city, and because of this, many outsiders feel uncomfortable living within its walls.</p>
<p>At-Mekin is far from any body of water and is largely self-sufficient, yet every city has its merits. The most mystical of the Scales, the space scale resides in the heart of the city, drawing many warriors into town to get a taste of the essence. The most renowned warriors of the Azzars draw their swords in allegiance to the scale and use its mysticism in their techniques.</p>
